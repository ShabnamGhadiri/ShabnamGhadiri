### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

3+ years of knowledge and experience in Data Science tasks, especially ML/DL engineering in financial time series forecasting, hybrid modeling (mainly neuro-fuzzy) of financial ratios of stock companies, bankruptcy detection, and many other projects, in both research and industrial environments. My current area of interest is time series forecasting on stock data in the Iranian stock market using ML tree models including LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and their ensemble. Also, my other research focus is on developing a novel parallel model consisting of CNN and LSTM deep NNs on financial data.
