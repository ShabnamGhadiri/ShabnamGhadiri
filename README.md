### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

3+ years of knowledge and experience in Data Science tasks, especially ML/DL engineering in financial time series forecasting, hybrid modeling (mainly neuro-fuzzy) of financial ratios of stock companies, bankruptcy detection, and many other projects, in both research and industrial environments. 

Current Interests: 

* Time series forecasting on stock data in the Iranian stock market using ML tree models including LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and their ensemble. 
* Developing a novel parallel model consisting of CNN and LSTM deep NNs on financial data.
